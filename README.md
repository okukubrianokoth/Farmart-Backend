Single-database configuration for Flask.

#  Farmart Backend

## Overview
Farmart is a backend API built with **Flask** that connects farmers directly to buyers, eliminating middlemen who reduce farmers’ profits. The API enables farmers to list animals for sale, while users can browse, search, filter, order, and pay for animals — all within a secure and scalable platform.
